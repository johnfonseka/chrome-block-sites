# Extention: Page Blocker

**Motivation**

I am wasting so much of my time or reels and short videos. This is now affecting my carrer and other aspects of life. I am suspecting this causes stress and even some psycological problems like unable to keep my attention and no motivation etc.
Hence I decided to go ahead and build a simple plugin to block these sites. Particularly facebook and youtube. But youtube music is allowed.

Blocked sites are stored at

TODO

- Add keyword based blocks
- Add password bypass
- Better utilize network calls with local storage
- Better way to store data more securely and reliably
- Function to limit number of time a one can visit a page for a given time period

TODO far far away

- Add a dashboard to show site stats based on base url, keyword
